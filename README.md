## Objective: Mastering K-Means Clustering

### 1. Theoretical Mastery

    - k-means algorithm
    - euclidean distance

### 2. Algorithmic Implementation

    - k-means clustering from scratch
    - k-means clustering with libraries

### 3. Performance Analysis

    - Inertia (within-cluster sum-of-square) : how well clusters are formed
    - Silhouette score : quantify closeness of samples between clusters
    - Elbow method to select optimal k

### 4. Advanced Techniques for K-Means Clustering

    - k-Means++ (improves init steps by spreading out initial centroids)
    - mini-batch k-Means: uses small random subsets of data to update centroids (reduce time)
    - k-Medoids : uses actual data points as centroids (medoids)
